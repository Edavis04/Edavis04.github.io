### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is where everything started, the anxious rush from dealing with linux setup. Even after that, experiencing the terminal for the first time felt like I was hacking into the mainframe. Although, all I did was open the code and edited the header, then pushed it back to github. A simple task now, but it was once daunting, but it shows the progression.

* Lab 4
    Lab 4 part 1 is a project I will remember as I poked at the capabilities of coding. During this lab my partner and I were coding up 4 functions that were originally 4 lines long per function, but after some guidence from the lab director we were able to condence the funtions to only be one line per function. I learned that there is a high skill ceiling in efficiently coding that is going to be a never-ending journey of constantly improving.



* Lab 8 
    Lab 8 part 1 consisted of something new and refreshing to me because I was getting tired of having the same kind of output. In this lab, my task was to make a pattern out of dashes, lines, and asterisks, which was confusing at first. For example, a single incorrect "<" sign made my whole program not run and execute properly and this taught me to realize that mistakes are going to be made, but I have to remember to learn from that mistake.
